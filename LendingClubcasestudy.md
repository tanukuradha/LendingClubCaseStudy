## General Information
- This project focuses on Loan defaulters. The goal is to identify patterns in customer and loan data that can predict whether a customer is likely to default.
- The business problem being addressed is how a consumer finance company can minimize losses by making smarter loan approval decisions. 
- The dataset used in this project is the loan.csv provided for our case study.It contains information on past loan applicants, including details about their financial status, loan amounts, and whether they defaulted or not.

## Conclusions
- Applicants with a higher Debt-to-income ratio tend to have a higher risk of default.
- Lower loan grades (indicating higher risk) are associated with more defaults.
- Interest rates are correlated with the likelihood of default, as riskier applicants are often given higher interest rates.
